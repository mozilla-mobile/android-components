      A test-only, disabled metric. This is required to guarantee
      that a `GleanGeckoHistogramMapping` is always generated, even
      though the GeckoView AAR exports no metric. Please note that
      the data-review field below contains no review, since this
      metric is disabled and not allowed to collect any data.
