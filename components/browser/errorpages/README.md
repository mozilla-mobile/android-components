# [Android Components](../../../README.md) > Browser > Errorpages

Responsive browser error pages for Android apps.

## Usage

### Setting up the dependency

Use gradle to download the library from JCenter:

```Groovy
implementation "org.mozilla.components:browser-errorpages:{latest-version}"
```
### Quick Start

If you have an `ErrorType` already at hand, and you want to generate an error page for it with the default template:

```kotlin
val errorType: ErrorType = ErrorType.Unknown
ErrorPages.createErrorPage(context, errorType)

// OR

ErrorPages.createErrorPage(context, errorType, R.raw.custom_html, R.raw.custom_css)
```

If you want to use your own custom HTML template, make sure that you have the following attributes within percentage values (`%`) added to your document so that they can be populated by the engine:
- `pageTitle` - Title of the page.
- `css` - The location of where to place the CSS contents in the document.
- `messageShort` - A one line description of the error message
Gecko and System engines map their respective error codes to the `ErrorType` values.
- `messageLong` - A more detailed message about the error that was seen.
- `button` - Button text that can be clicked on. This is commonly used to reload the page.

For example, here is an HTML error page that will have only a title, short message and some CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; user-scalable=false;" />
        <title>%pageTitle%</title>
        <style>%css%</style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1 class="errorTitleText">%messageShort%</h1>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Error Pages are also mostly used along with the `RequestInterceptor`, which can be added to an Engine's Settings:

```kotlin
val settings = DefaultSettings(
    requestInterceptor = RequestInterceptor {
        override fun onErrorRequest(
            session: EngineSession,
            errorType: ErrorType,
            uri: String?
        ): RequestInterceptor.ErrorResponse? =
             RequestInterceptor.ErrorResponse(ErrorPages.createErrorPage(context, errorType))
    }
)
GeckoEngine(settings)
```

See the `ErrorType` enum for the full list of supported error types.

### Engine Support

If you want to add support for another engine, you need to support the `RequestInterceptor` and have it invoked with an `ErrorType` based on the `EngineSession`'s' error code for that request:

```kotlin
class CustomEngineSession(val interceptor: RequestInterceptor) : EngineSession {
    override onError(errorCode: Int, uri: String) {
        val errorType = when (errorCode) {
            1..5 -> ErrorType.ERROR_SECURITY_SSL
            else -> ErrorType.ERROR_OFFLINE
        }
        interceptor.onErrorRequest(session, errorType, uri)
    }
}
```
