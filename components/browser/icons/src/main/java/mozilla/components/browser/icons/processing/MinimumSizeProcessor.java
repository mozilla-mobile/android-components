/**
 * Substitutes a generated image for the given icon if it doesn't not meet the minimum size requirement.
 *
 * Ideally, we would discard images while we're loading them: if we found an icon that was too small, we
 * would have the opportunity to search other places before generating an icon and we wouldn't duplicate
 * the generate icon call. However, this turned out to be non-trivial: a single icon will appear as two
 * different sizes when given to the loader, the original size the first time it's loaded and the size after
 * {@link ResizingProcessor} the second time, when it's loaded from the cache. It turned out to be much simpler
 * to enforce the requirement that...
 *
 * This processor is expected to be called after {@link ResizingProcessor}.
