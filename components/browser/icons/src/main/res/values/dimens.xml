         this will be downscaled to this value. If you need to use larger Favicons (Due to a UI
         redesign sometime after this is written) you should increase this value to the largest
         commonly-used size of favicon and, performance permitting, fetch the remainder from the
         database. The largest available size is always stored in the database, regardless of this
         value.-->
