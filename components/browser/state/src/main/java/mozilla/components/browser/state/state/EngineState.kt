 * @property engineSessionState serializable and restorable state of an engine session, see
 * [EngineSession.saveState] and [EngineSession.restoreState].
 * @property engineObserver the [EngineSession.Observer] linked to [engineSession]. It is
 * used to observe engine events and update the store. It should become obsolete, once the
 * migration to browser state is complete, as the engine will then have direct access to
