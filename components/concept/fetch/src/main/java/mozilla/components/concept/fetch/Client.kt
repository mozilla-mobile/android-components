     * its [Response.Body].

     *
     * ```Kotlin
     * client.fetch(request).use { response ->
     *     // Use response. Resources will get released automatically at the end of the block.
     * }

     *
     * Alternatively you can use multiple `use*()` methods on the [Response.Body] object.
     *
     * @param request The request to be executed by this [Client].
     * @return The [Response] returned by the server.
     * @throws IOException if the request could not be executed due to cancellation, a connectivity problem or a
     * timeout.
