/**
 * A Firefox Sync friendly auth object which can be obtained from [OAuthAccount].
 *
 * Why is there a Firefox Sync-shaped authentication object at the concept level, you ask?
 * Mainly because this is what the [SyncableStore] consumes in order to actually perform
 * synchronization, which is in turn implemented by `places`-backed storage layer.
 * If this class lived in `services-firefox-accounts`, we'd end up with an ugly dependency situation
 * between services and storage components.
 *
 * Turns out that building a generic description of an authentication/synchronization layer is not
 * quite the way to go when you only have a single, legacy implementation.
 *
 * However, this may actually improve once we retire the tokenserver from the architecture.
 * We could also consider a heavier use of generics, as well.
