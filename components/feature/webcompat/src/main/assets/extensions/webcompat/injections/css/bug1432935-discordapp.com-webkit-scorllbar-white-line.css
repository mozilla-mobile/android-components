/**
 * discordapp.com - -webkit-scrollbar dependency causes visible white line
 * Part of Bug #1432935 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432935
 * WebCompat issue #7919 - https://webcompat.com/issues/7919
 *
 * Discord depends on -webkit-scrollbar for styling and hiding their scrollbars
 * in the UI. Previously, the scrollbars overlapped content permanently.
 * However, this issue seems to be addressed now, but a small white line
 * still remains. While Discord is working on this, let's get rid of these
 * lines.
