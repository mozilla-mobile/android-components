/**
 * twitch.tv - Comment interaction button is overlayed by scrollbar
 * Bug #1518781 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1518781
 *
 * The interaction buttons in Twitch' chat are partly overlayed by the
 * scrollbar, which makes them hard to use. Twitch uses
 * ::-webkit-scrollbar to make the scrollbar thinner, which isn't working in
 * Firefox.
 * Given that even scrollbar-width: thin; is not enough (see Bugzilla), let's
 * remove it entirely.
