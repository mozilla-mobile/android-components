/**
 * sreedharscce.in - Fix login form with CSS intervention
 * Bug #1526977 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1526977
 * WebCompat issue #21505 - https://webcompat.com/issues/21505
 *
 * The login form is partly moved out of the screen on sreedharscce.in in
 * Firefox. Enforcing the body height to the full viewport fixes this issue,
 * as the login form itself is posititoned with `position: absolute;`.
