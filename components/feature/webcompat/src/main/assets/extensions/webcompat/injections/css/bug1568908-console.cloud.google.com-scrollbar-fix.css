/**
 * console.cloud.google.com - Double scrollbar visisible on long pages
 * Bug #1568908 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568908
 * WebCompat issue #33164 - https://webcompat.com/issues/33164
 *
 * For pages that have contents heigher than the page's height, a secondary
 * scrollbar outside the scrollable content area is visible. This is caused
 * by a difference in Flexbox behavior, which is being addressed in
 * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=981134
 *
 * Until this fix hits release and Google has updated their UI properly,
 * this intervention addresses the differences.
