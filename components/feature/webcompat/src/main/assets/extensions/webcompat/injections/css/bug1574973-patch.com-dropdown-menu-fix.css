 * WebCompat issue #25384 - https://webcompat.com/issues/25384
 *
 * patch.con has a top:100% style on the relatively-positioned element
 * with class="dropdown-menu", and Firefox is incorrectly honoring that
 * style (resolving it to something nonzero), whereas Chrome just treats it as "auto"
 * see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1092007
