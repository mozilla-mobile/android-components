 * WebCompat issue #17810 - https://webcompat.com/issues/17810
 *
 * The site does not have a doctype and is rendered in quirks mode. The calc() percentage
 * height is applied on the .main-page .viewWrap element, but its parent does not have
 * a specified height property. Adding a height of 100% to the parent fixes the issue.
