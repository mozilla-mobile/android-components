## metrics

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`metrics` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/metrics.html).

All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration | [Data Sensitivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| crash_metrics.crash_count |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of crashes that occur in the application. This measures only the counts of each crash in association with the labeled type of the crash. The labels correspond to the types of crashes handled by lib-crash. Deprecated: `native_code_crash` replaced by `fatal_native_code_crash` and `nonfatal_native_code_crash`  |[Bug 1553935](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1553935#c3), [mozilla-mobile/android-components#5700](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/5700#pullrequestreview-347721248)|<ul><li>uncaught_exception</li><li>caught_exception</li><li>fatal_native_code_crash</li><li>nonfatal_native_code_crash</li></ul>|never |1 |
