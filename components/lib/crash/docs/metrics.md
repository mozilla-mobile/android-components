## metrics

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`metrics` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/metrics.html).

The following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration |
