            // - `viewLifecycleOwner` is only available in alpha versions of AndroidX currently.

            //   causing this coroutine to run forever.
            //   See: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/3828
            // Once those two issues get resolved we can remove the `isAdded` check and use
            // `viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope` instead of the view scope.
            //
            // In a previous version we tried using `isAdded` and `isDetached` here. But in certain
            // situations they reported true/false in situations where no activity was attached to
            // the fragment. Therefore we switched to explicitly check for the activity and view here.

 * bound to the [View] of the [Fragment]. Once the [View] gets detached, the coroutine scope will
 * automatically be cancelled and no longer observe the [Store].
 *
 * An optional [LifecycleOwner] can be passed to this method. It will be used to automatically pause
 * and resume the [Store] subscription. With that an application can, for example, automatically
 * stop updating the UI if the application is in the background. Once the [Lifecycle] switches back
 * to at least STARTED state then the latest [State] and further will be passed to the [Flow] again.
 * By default, the fragment itself is used as a [LifecycleOwner].
