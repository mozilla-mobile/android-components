## Before using the library
Products using Glean to collect telemetry **must**:

- add documentation for any new metric collected with the library in its repository (see [an example](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/df429df1a193516f796f2330863af384cce820bc/components/service/glean/docs/pings/pings.md));
- go through data review for the newly collected data by following [this process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection);
- provide a way for users to turn data collection off (e.g. providing settings to control
  `Glean.setUploadEnabled()`).

## Usage

### Setting up the dependency

Use Gradle to download the library from [maven.mozilla.org](https://maven.mozilla.org/) 
([Setup repository](../../../README.md#maven-repository)):

```Groovy
implementation "org.mozilla.components:service-glean:{latest-version}"
```

### Integrating with the build system

In order for Glean to work, a Python environment must be accessible at build time. This is done
automatically by the [`com.jetbrains.python.envs`](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-python-envs/)
plugin. The plugin **must** be manually enabled by adding the following `plugins` block at the top
of the `build.gradle` file for your app module.

```Groovy
plugins {
    id "com.jetbrains.python.envs" version "0.0.26"
}
```

Right before the end of the same file, the Glean build script must be included. This script can be
referenced directly from the GitHub repo, as shown below:

```Groovy
apply from: 'https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/raw/v{latest-version}/components/service/glean/scripts/sdk_generator.gradle'
```

**Important:** the `{latest-version}` placeholder in the above link should be replaced with the version
number of the Glean library used by the project. For example, if version *0.34.2* is used, then the
include directive becomes:

```Groovy
apply from: 'https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/raw/v0.34.2/components/service/glean/scripts/sdk_generator.gradle'
```

### Initializing Glean

Before any data collection can take place, Glean **must** be initialized from the application. An
excellent place to perform this operation is within the `onCreate` method of the class that extends
Android's `Application` class.

```Kotlin
import org.mozilla.yourApplication.GleanMetrics.Pings

class SampleApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // If you have custom pings in your application, you must register them
        // using the following command. This command should be omitted for
        // applications not using custom pings.
        Glean.registerPings(Pings)

        // Call setUploadEnabled first, since Glean.initialize
        // might send pings if there are any metrics queued up
        // from a previous run.
        Glean.setUploadEnabled(Settings.isTelemetryEnabled)

        // Initialize the Glean library.
        Glean.initialize(applicationContext)
    }
}
```

Once initialized, if collection is enabled, Glean will automatically start collecting [baseline metrics](metrics.yaml)
and sending its [pings](docs/pings/pings.md).

Glean should be initialized as soon as possible, and importantly, before any
other libraries in the application start using Glean. Library code should never
call `Glean.initialize`, since it should be called exactly once per application.

**Note**: if the application has the concept of release channels and knows which channel it is on at
run-time, then it can provide Glean with this information by setting it as part of the `Configuration`
object parameter of the `Glean.initialize` method. For example:

```Kotlin
Glean.initialize(applicationContext, Configuration(channel = "beta"))
```

### Adding new metrics

All metrics that your application collects must be defined in a `metrics.yaml`
file. This file should be at the root of the application module (the same
directory as the `build.gradle` file you updated). The format of that file is
documented [here](https://mozilla.github.io/glean_parser/metrics-yaml.html).
To learn more, see [adding new metrics](docs/metrics/adding-new-metrics.md).

**Important**: as stated [here](#before-using-the-library), any new data collection requires
documentation and data-review. This is also required for any new metric automatically collected
by Glean.

### Adding custom pings

Please refer to the custom pings documentation living [here](docs/pings/custom.md).

**Important**: as stated [here](#before-using-the-library), any new data collection, including
new custom pings, requires documentation and data-review. This is also required for any new ping automatically collected by Glean.

### Testing metrics

In order to make testing metrics easier 'out of the box', all metrics include a set of test API 
functions in order to facilitate unit testing.  These include functions to test whether a value has
been stored, and functions to retrieve the stored value for validation.  For more information, 
please refer to [Unit testing Glean metrics](docs/metrics/testing-metrics.md).

### Providing UI to enable / disable metrics

Every application must provide a way to disable and re-enable data collection
and upload. This is controlled with the `glean.setUploadEnabled()` method. The
application should provide some form of user interface to call this method.
Additionally, it is good practice to call this method immediately before calling
`Glean.initialize()` to ensure that Glean doesn't send any pings at start up
when telemetry is disabled.

## Debugging products using Glean
Glean exports the [`GleanDebugActivity`](src/main/java/mozilla/components/service/glean/debug/GleanDebugActivity.kt)
that can be used to toggle debugging features on or off. Users can invoke this special activity, at
run-time, using the following [`adb`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) command:

`adb shell am start -n [applicationId]/mozilla.components.service.glean.debug.GleanDebugActivity [extra keys]`

In the above:

- `[applicationId]` is the product's application id as defined in the manifest
  file and/or build script. For the Glean sample application, this is
  `org.mozilla.samples.glean` for a release build and
  `org.mozilla.samples.glean.debug` for a debug build.

- `[extra keys]` is a list of extra keys to be passed to the debug activity. See the
  [documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#IntentSpec)
  for the command line switches used to pass the extra keys. These are the
  currently supported keys:

    |key|type|description|
    |---|----|-----------|
    | logPings | boolean (--ez) | If set to `true`, Glean dumps pings to logcat; defaults to `false` |
    | sendPing | string (--es) | Sends the ping with the given name immediately |
    | tagPings | string (--es) | Tags all outgoing pings as debug pings to make them available for real-time validation. The value must match the pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,20}` |

For example, to direct a release build of the Glean sample application to (1) dump pings to logcat, (2) tag the ping 
with the `test-metrics-ping` tag, and (3) send the "metrics" ping immediately, the following command
can be used:

```
adb shell am start -n org.mozilla.samples.glean/mozilla.components.service.glean.debug.GleanDebugActivity \
  --ez logPings true \
  --es sendPing metrics \
  --es tagPings test-metrics-ping
```

### Important GleanDebugActivity note!

Options that are set using the adb flags are not immediately reset and will persist until the application is closed or manually reset.

Further documentation for pings that Glean can send out of the box is available [here](docs/pings/pings.md).
