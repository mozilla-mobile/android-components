baseline:
  description: >
    This ping is intended to provide metrics that are managed by the library
    itself, and not explicitly set by the application or included in the
    application's `metrics.yaml` file.
    The `baseline` ping is automatically sent when the application is moved to
    the background.

metrics:
  description: >
    The `metrics` ping is intended for all of the metrics that are explicitly
    set by the application or are included in the application's `metrics.yaml`
    file (except events).
    The reported data is tied to the ping's *measurement window*, which is the
    time between the collection of two `metrics` ping. Ideally, this window is
    expected to be about 24 hours, given that the collection is scheduled daily
    at 4AM. Data in the `ping_info` section of the ping can be used to infer the
    length of this window.

events:
  description: >
    The events ping's purpose is to transport all of the event metric information.
    The `events` ping is automatically sent when the application is moved to
    the background.
