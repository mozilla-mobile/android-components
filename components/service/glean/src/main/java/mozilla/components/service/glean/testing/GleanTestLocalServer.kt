/**
 * This implements a JUnit rule for writing tests for Glean SDK metrics.
 *
 * The rule takes care of sending Glean SDK pings to a local server, at the
 * address: "http://localhost:<port>".
 *
 * This is useful for Android instrumented tests, where we don't want to
 * initialize Glean more than once but still want to send pings to a local
 * server for validation.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ```
 * // Add the following lines to you test class.
 * @get:Rule
 * val gleanRule = GleanTestLocalServer(3785)
 * ```
 *
 * @param localPort the port of the local ping server
