# [Android Components](../../../README.md) > Service > Telemetry

A generic library for sending telemetry pings from Android applications to Mozilla's telemetry service.

## Motivation

The goal of this library is to provide a generic set of components to support a variety of telemetry use cases. It tries to not be opinionated about dependency injection frameworks or http clients. The only dependency is ``support-annotations`` to ensure code quality.

## Usage

### Setting up the dependency

Use gradle to download the library from JCenter:

```Groovy
implementation "org.mozilla.components:telemetry:{latest-version}
```
