     * Enable the Rust log adapter.
     *
     * This does almost (see below) nothing if you are not in a megazord build.
     * After calling this, logs emitted by Rust code are forwarded to any
     * LogSinks attached to [Log].
     *
     * Megazording is required due to each dynamically loaded Rust library having
     * its own internal/private version of the Rust logging framework. When
     * megazording, this is still true, but there's only a single dynamically
     * loaded library, and so it is redirected properly.
     *
     * Note that non-megazord versions of the Rust libraries will log directly to
     * logcat by default (at DEBUG level), so while they cannot hook into the base
     * component log system, they still have logs available for development use.
     *
     * (We say "almost" nothing, as calling this will hook up logging for the dynamic
     * library containing the Rust log hooking (and only that), as well as logging
     * a single message indicating that it completed initialization).
     *
     * @param crashReporter [CrashReporting] instance used for reporting 'error' log messages.
