      Unique identifier for this sync, used to correlate together
      individual pings for data types that were synchronized together
      (history, bookmarks, logins).
      If a data type is synchronized by itself via the legacy 'sync' API
      (as opposed to the Sync Manager),
      then this field will not be set on the corresponding ping.

# `history-sync`, `logins-sync`, `bookmarks-sync`, `creditcards-sync`,
# `addresses-sync` and `tabs-sync` metrics
# mostly use the same structure, with some minor variability,
# but must be specified individually. We can't define them once and use
# `send_in_pings` because the stores might be synced in parallel, and we can't
# guarantee that a ping for one store would be sent before the others.
