      Unique identifier for this sync, used to correlate together
      individual pings for data types that were synchronized together
      (history, bookmarks, logins).
      If a data type is synchronized by itself via the legacy 'sync' API
      (as opposed to the Sync Manager),
      then this field will not be set on the corresponding ping.

# `history-sync`, `logins-sync` and `bookmarks-sync` metrics
# all use the same structure,
# but must be specified individually. We can't define them once and use
# `send_in_pings` because the stores might be synced in parallel, and we can't
# guarantee that a ping for one store would be sent before the others.
