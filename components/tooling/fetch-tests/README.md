# [Android Components](../../../README.md) > Tooling > Fetch tests

A generic test suite for components that implement [concept-fetch](../../concept/fetch/README.md).

All implementations of [concept-fetch](../../concept/fetch/README.md) are expected to pass this test suite. A shared test suite guarantees that the HTTP clients are "pluggable" and implementations behave similar enough so that every component can work with every HTTP client.
