This directory contains a Gradle plugin for build-time functionality, such as generating specific metrics and documentation.

See [the Glean documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/user/adding-glean-to-your-project.md) for information about using this plugin.

This is just a thin wrapper around the actual plugin implementation that is published as part of [Glean itself.](https://github.com/mozilla/glean/).
