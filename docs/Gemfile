# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
gem "jekyll", "~> 3.9.2"

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
gem "minima", "~> 2.5.1"

# Update kramdown
gem "kramdown", ">= 2.3.2"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
gem "github-pages", 227, group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
