* [Commits](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/compare/v0.17...v0.18),
[Milestone](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/milestone/16?closed=1),
[API reference](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/api/0.18/index)

* Compiled against:
  * Android support libraries 27.1.1
  * Kotlin Standard library 1.2.60
  * Kotlin coroutines 0.23.4
  * GeckoView
    * Nightly: **63.0.20180810100129** (2018.08.10, d999fb858fb2c007c5be4af72bce419c63c69b8e) ðŸ”º
    * Beta: **62.0b15** (7ce198bb7ce027d450af3f69a609896671adfab8) ðŸ”º
    * Release: 61.0 (785d242a5b01d5f1094882aa2144d8e5e2791e06)

* **engine-gecko-beta**: Since the [Load Progress Tracking API](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437988) was uplifted to GeckoView Beta  _engine-gecko-beta_ now reports progress via `EngineSession.Observer.onProgress()`.
* **service-fretboard**: KintoExperimentSource can now validate the signature of the downloaded experiments configuration (`validateSignature` flag). This ensures that the configuration was signed by Mozilla and was not modified by a bad actor. For now the `validateSignature` flag is off by default until this has been tested in production. Various bugfixes and refactorings.
* **service-firefox-accounts**: JNA native libraries are no longer part of the AAR and instead referenced as a dependency. This avoids duplication when multiple libraries depend on JNA.
* API references for every release are now generated and hosted online: [https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/reference/](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/reference/)
* Documentation and more is now hosted at: [https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/). More content coming soon.
* **tooling-lint**: New (internal-only) component containing custom lint rules.
