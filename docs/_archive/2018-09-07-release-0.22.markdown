## News

* Firefox for Amazon's Fire TV is now using the browser-session, feature-session and browser-engine-system components. This simplified the code base by removing ~4000 lines of code (see [PR #1044](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-tv/pull/1044) and [PR #982](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-tv/pull/982) for details).

* Kudos to the application-services team for various bug fixes in our service-firefox-accounts component (see [commits](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/compare/v0.21...v0.22) for details).

* We now provide aggregated API docs. The docs for this release are hosted at: https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/api/0.22
* **browser-engine-***:
  * EngineView now exposes lifecycle methods with default implementations. A `LifecycleObserver` implementation is provided which forwards events to EngineView instances.
  ```Kotlin
  lifecycle.addObserver(EngineView.LifecycleObserver(view))
   ```
  * Added engine setting for blocking web fonts:
  ```Kotlin
  GeckoEngine(runtime, DefaultSettings(webFontsEnabled = false))
  ```
  * `setDesktopMode()` was renamed to `toggleDesktopMode()`.
* **browser-engine-system**: The `X-Requested-With` header is now cleared (set to an empty String).
* **browser-session**: Desktop mode can be observed now:
  ```Kotlin
  session.register(object : Session.Observer {
      fun onDesktopModeChange(enabled: Boolean) {
          // ..
      }
  })
  ```
* **service-fretboard**:
  * `Fretboard` now has synchronous methods for adding and clearing overrides: `setOverrideNow()`, `clearOverrideNow`, `clearAllOverridesNow`.
  * Access to `Experiment.id` is now deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in a future release (target: 0.24). The `id` is an implementation detail of the underlying storage service and was not meant to be exposed to apps.
* **ui-tabcounter**: Due to a packaging error previous releases of this component didn't contain any compiled code. This is the first usable release of the component.
