  * Kotlin Standard library 1.2.60
  * Kotlin coroutines 0.23.4
  * GeckoView
    * Nightly: **63.0.20180810100129** (2018.08.10, d999fb858fb2c007c5be4af72bce419c63c69b8e) ðŸ”º
    * Beta: **62.0b15** (7ce198bb7ce027d450af3f69a609896671adfab8) ðŸ”º
    * Release: 61.0 (785d242a5b01d5f1094882aa2144d8e5e2791e06)

* **concept-engine**, **engine-system**, **engine-gecko**: Added new API to load data and HTML directly (without loading a URL). Added the ability to stop loading a page.
* **ui-autocomplete**: Fixed a bug that caused soft keyboards and the InlineAutocompleteEditText component to desync.
* **service-firefox-accounts**: Added JNA-specific proguard rules so consumers of this library don't have to add them to their app (see https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.md#jna-on-android for details). Underlying libfxa_client.so no longer depends on versioned .so names. All required dependencies are now statically linked which simplified our dependency setup as well.
