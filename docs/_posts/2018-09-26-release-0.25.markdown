* ⚠️ **This is the last release compiled against Android SDK 27. Upcoming releases of the components will require Android SDK 28**.
* **service-fretboard**:
  * Fixed a bug in `FlatFileExperimentStorage` that caused updated experiment configurations not being saved to disk.
  * Added [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/WorkManager) implementation for updating experiment configurations in the background (See ``WorkManagerSyncScheduler``).
  * `Experiment.id` is not accessible by component consumers anymore.
* **browser-engine-system**:
  * URL changes are now reported earlier; when the URL of the main frame changes.
  * Fixed an issue where fullscreen mode would only take up part of the screen.
  * Fixed a crash that could happen when loading invalid URLs.
  * `RequestInterceptor.onErrorRequest()` can return custom error page content to be displayed now (the original URL that caused the error will be preserved).
* **feature-intent**: New component providing intent processing functionality (Code moved from *feature-session*).
* **support-utils**: `DownloadUtils.guessFileName()` will replace extension in the URL with the MIME type file extension if needed (`http://example.com/file.aspx` + `image/jpeg` -> `file.jpg`).
