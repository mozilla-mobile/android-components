**TLDR:** Follow the [changelog](/android-components/changelog) for release updates instead!

As you may have noticed, there haven't been any release announcements of late.. do not fear! We still continue our releases as normal, but in order to better invest our time, we've decided to keep our [changelog](/android-components/changelog) as the single source of truth. You can use it to follow the progress of our current snapshot and all previous releases (which also include code samples!)

We'll continue to use this blog for other announcements or information to share. ðŸ™‚
