## Package org.mozilla.telemetry.config

### Types

| [TelemetryConfiguration](-telemetry-configuration/index.html) | `open class TelemetryConfiguration`<br>The TelemetryConfiguration class collects the information describing the telemetry setup of an app. There are some parts that every app needs to configure: Where should measurements store data? What servers are we actually uploading pings to? This class should provide good defaults so that in the best case it is not needed to modify the configuration. |
