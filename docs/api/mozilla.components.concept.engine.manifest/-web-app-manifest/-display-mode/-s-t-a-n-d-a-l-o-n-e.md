# STANDALONE

`STANDALONE` [(source)](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/master/components/concept/engine/src/main/java/mozilla/components/concept/engine/manifest/WebAppManifest.kt#L80)

The application will look and feel like a standalone application. This can include the application having a
different window, its own icon in the application launcher, etc. In this mode, the user agent will exclude
UI elements for controlling navigation, but can include other UI elements such as a status bar.
