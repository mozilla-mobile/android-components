`DownloadDialogFragment()`

This is a general representation of a dialog meant to be used in collaboration with [DownloadsFeature](../-downloads-feature/index.md)
to show a dialog before a download is triggered.
If [SimpleDownloadDialogFragment](../-simple-download-dialog-fragment/index.md) is not flexible enough for your use case you should inherit for this class.
Be mindful to call [onStartDownload](on-start-download.md) when you want to start the download.
