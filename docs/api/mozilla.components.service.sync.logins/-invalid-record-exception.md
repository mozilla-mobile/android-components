# InvalidRecordException

`typealias InvalidRecordException = InvalidRecordException` [(source)](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/master/components/service/sync-logins/src/main/java/mozilla/components/service/sync/logins/SyncableLoginsStorage.kt#L89)

This is thrown on attempts to insert or update a record so that it
is no longer valid, where "invalid" is defined as such:

* A record with a blank `password` is invalid.
* A record with a blank `hostname` is invalid.
* A record that doesn't have a `formSubmitURL` nor a `httpRealm` is invalid.
* A record that has both a `formSubmitURL` and a `httpRealm` is invalid.
