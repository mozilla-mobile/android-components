## Before the release

- Make sure version number is correct or update version in `.buildconfig.yml`.
- Update [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/master/docs/changelog.md)
  - Use milestone and commit log for identifying interesting changes.
  - Add the milestone to any related issue that doesn't have it.
- Close milestone
  - Milestone should be 100% complete. Incomplete issues should have been moved in planning meeting.

## Release

- Create a new tag/release on GitHub.
  - Tag: v2.0 (_v_ prefix!)
  - Release 2.0
- Wait for taskcluster to complete successfully.
- Check that new versions are on [maven.mozilla.org](https://maven.mozilla.org/?prefix=maven2/org/mozilla/components/):

### Minor releases

Making a minor release has a couple extra steps to do before a regular release:

- Create a branch with the format `releases/[major_version].0`, for example, `releases/49.0`.
- [Cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) the changes to the new branch.
- Create the tag and release from this branch instead.

## After the release

- Send release message to the [Matrix channel](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#android-components:mozilla.org):
```
