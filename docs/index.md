# Overview

**Mozilla Android Components** is a collection of independent, reusable Android library components to make it easier to build browsers and browser-like applications.

# Motivation

* ðŸš€ **Accelerate development**: Our components are customizable building blocks that are individually adoptable but built to work together.

* ðŸ“‰ **Reduce maintenance overhead**: Building a browser is a complex task. With the use of our components you get a solid foundation to build on top of.
