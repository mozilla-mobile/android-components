        Every time you click on the button above, the text is added to the test_string_list metric
        and a counter metric type called testCounter is incremented. Both of these will be included
        when the ping is sent. The counter and the string list are utilizing the `user` lifetime
        and should persist from launch to launch of the app.\n\nAn event metric is also being used
        to attach a dictionary of values to the extras of the event ping. See MainActivity for
        where all of this is happening.
